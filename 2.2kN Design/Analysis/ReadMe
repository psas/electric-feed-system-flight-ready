This folder contains computational fluid dynamic (CFD) results for the EFS fluid simulation. A folder titled ‘Cryo Thermal Testing’ holds drawings used in the cyrogenic liquid nitrogen test. These drawings indicate what dimensions of individual parts were measured before and after being dunked in LN2.

The hydrualic design analysis procedure and design calculation tools are contained within this folder. Additionally, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) results for the EFS fluid simulation are found here, as well as drawings used in the cyrogenic liquid nitrogen test. These drawings indicate what dimensions of individual parts were measured before and after being dunked in LN2.

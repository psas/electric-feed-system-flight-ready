Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) requires a Flight-Ready Electric Feed System for their upcoming Launch Vehicle 4 (LV4). An Electric Feed System (EFS) is an electronically controlled pump system used to provide the necessary pressure to deliver liquid propellant to the engine. The EFS must be cryogenic compatible to withstand the environment that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) propellants create. In traditional amateur rocketry, a high pressure "blow down" system is used to deliver propellant to the engine in place of "blow down" propellant tanks.
